## How to run the project?
You just need to install the Processing IDE to run on Desktop, and if you want to run on android, you need to install the Android Mode on your Processing IDE.

Here is the Processing IDE download link: [Processing IDE Download](https://processing.org/download/)<br>
Here is a tutorial about how to install the Android mode on your Processing IDE: [Android mode tutorial](https://android.processing.org/install.html)<br>

After installing the Processing, you need to download the repo, and open the Solar.pde file and click run, if you are trying to run on android, select android mode and click run.

Or if you just want to run on your android, you can download the [Solar.apk](https://github.com/viniciuseb/Solar/raw/master/Solar.apk) file from the repo and install it on you android device.
